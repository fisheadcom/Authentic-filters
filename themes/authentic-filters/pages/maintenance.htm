        <h1>The Advantage of our Maintenance Program<span class="underline-header "></span></h1>

        <p>The total cost of your filter exchange, hood clean and duct and fan clean over a twelve-month period is
            divided evenly into the number of visits per year. </p>
        <p>The major advantage of this program is that your duct clean is paid off weekly or monthly thus preventing any
            cash flow problems. The other advantage is that the price is fixed for twelve months eliminating any price
            increase. </p>
        <p>Insurance companies and Councilâ€™s often require written proof of your cleaning program to show when and what
            work is being completed during the twelve-month period. Some insurance companies want a guarantee that the
            duct is cleaned on a regular basis. A maintenance program covers that guarantee.</p>
