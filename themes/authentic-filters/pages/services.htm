                <h1>Filter Exchange Program<span class="underline-header "></span></h1>
                <p>The entire kitchen exhaust system works most efficiently with filters that are not clogged with
                    grease or oil, preventing a smoky kitchen, or not allowing fumes to get away. Depending on the type
                    of kitchen and cooking processes we ascertain the optimum, cost-effective filter exchange schedule.
                    Our aim is to minimise any disruption to your business and our contractors will work with you
                    whenever possible to arrange suitable times for exchange. How often should you exchange kitchen
                    filters? The exchange frequency depends on the volume and style of cooking in your kitchen. </p>

            <h1>Hood Cleaning Services<span class="underline-header "></span></h1>
            <p>Rangehoods are extremely important in a commercial kitchen. When functioning correctly they provide a
                cleaner work environment by improving air quality, controlling heat and steam and minimising kitchen
                odour. Depending on the volume and type of cooking, commercial kitchen hoods or canopies quickly
                accumulate oil and grease and require regular cleaning. Often this build up is not visible. It’s no good
                having clean filters but your gutters are overflowing with oil as this increases the likelihood of a
                fire and shortens the life of the filters.

            <h1>Duct & Fan Cleaning<span class="underline-header "></span></h1>
            <p>The hood is joined to a ducting (flue) system which flows through to the extraction fan. The fan draws
                air from the kitchen, through the honeycomb filters, the duct system to the fan where it is expelled
                into the environment. Grease and other food particles build up in the ducting system impacting on the
                airflow and the speed in which the fan works. We have removed dead cockroaches, rates, mice, birds and
                possums from filthy ducting systems. If the fan is not cleaned regularly, it will gradually slow down
                and stop altogether leaving a build-up of smoke and fumes in your kitchen. </p>
        </div>

    <div class="main-content">
        <h1>The Importance of cleaning Ducts & Fans<span class="underline-header "></span></h1>

        <p>Many insurance companies and environmental health departments require the ducting system to be cleaned on a
            regular basis usually every twelve months depending on the type of food outlet. Some companies require their
            ducts to be cleaned every four months. </p>
        <p>The duct cleaning cycle will depend on the environmental situation, the type of cooking your establishment is
            involved in, the frequency of the filter exchange and hood cleans, the setup of the fan system and most
            important your insurance company requirements. </p>
        <p>A primary defence against fire hazards in any kitchen is regular maintenance of the ducting system. Kitchens
            can become hot and even a small flare up while cooking can lead to flames entering the ducting system
            causing a fire. The intensity of the fire could be determined by the build-up of grease and particles in the
            ducting system. You wouldn’t want to see your business go up in smoke or cause an injury to a member of your
            staff. A regular clean means a safer ducting system preventing a build-up of fat. </p>
        <p>When Authentic Filters cleans a ducting system, the area behind the filters including the internal surface of
            the ducting system to the fan is cleaned. This process also covers the fan and housing on the roof. In many
            situations Authentic Filters needs to cut and install access panels into the ducting system to allow for a
            professional and thorough clean. </p>
