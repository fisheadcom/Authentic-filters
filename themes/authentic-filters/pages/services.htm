                <p>Rangehoods are extremely important in a commercial kitchen. When functioning correctly they provide a
                    cleaner work environment by improving air quality, controlling heat and steam and minimising kitchen
                    odour. Depending on the volume and type of cooking, commercial kitchen hoods or canopies quickly
                    accumulate oil and grease and require regular cleaning. Often this build up is not visible. Itâ€™s no
                    good
                    having clean filters but your gutters are overflowing with oil as this increases the likelihood of a
                    fire and shortens the life of the filters.

                <span class="underline-header "></span>
                <p>The hood is joined to a ducting (flue) system which flows through to the extraction fan. The fan
                    draws
                    air from the kitchen, through the honeycomb filters, the duct system to the fan where it is expelled
                    into the environment. Grease and other food particles build up in the ducting system impacting on
                    the
                    airflow and the speed in which the fan works. We have removed dead cockroaches, rates, mice, birds
                    and
                    possums from filthy ducting systems. If the fan is not cleaned regularly, it will gradually slow
                    down
                    and stop altogether leaving a build-up of smoke and fumes in your kitchen. </p>

                <span class="underline-header "></span>
            </div>
            <p>Many insurance companies and environmental health departments require the ducting system to be cleaned on
                a
                regular basis usually every twelve months depending on the type of food outlet. Some companies require
                their
                ducts to be cleaned every four months. </p>
            <p>The duct cleaning cycle will depend on the environmental situation, the type of cooking your
                establishment is
                involved in, the frequency of the filter exchange and hood cleans, the setup of the fan system and most
                important your insurance company requirements. </p>
            <span class="services-important-section">
            <p>A primary defence against fire hazards in any kitchen is regular maintenance of the ducting system.
                Kitchens
                can become hot and even a small flare up while cooking can lead to flames entering the ducting system
                causing a fire. The intensity of the fire could be determined by the build-up of grease and particles in
                the
                ducting system. You wouldnâ€™t want to see your business go up in smoke or cause an injury to a member of
                your
                staff. A regular clean means a safer ducting system preventing a build-up of fat. </p>
            <p>When Authentic Filters cleans a ducting system, the area behind the filters including the internal
                surface of
                the ducting system to the fan is cleaned. This process also covers the fan and housing on the roof. In
                many
                situations Authentic Filters needs to cut and install access panels into the ducting system to allow for
                a
                professional and thorough clean. </p>
