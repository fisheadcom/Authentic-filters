                        grease or oil, preventing a smoky kitchen, or not allowing fumes to get away. Depending on the
                        type of kitchen and cooking processes we ascertain the optimum, cost-effective filter exchange
                        schedule. <span class="filter ">&nbsp;Our aim is to minimise any disruption to your business and our contractors will work with you whenever possible to arrange suitable times for exchange. How often should you exchange kitchen filters? The exchange frequency depends on the volume and style of cooking in your kitchen.&nbsp;</span>

                <p>Rangehoods are extremely important in a commercial kitchen. When functioning correctly they provide a
                    cleaner work environment by improving air quality, controlling heat and steam and minimising kitchen
                    odour. Depending on the volume and type of cooking, commercial kitchen hoods or canopies quickly
                    accumulate oil and grease and require regular cleaning. Often this build up is not visible. Itâ€™s no
                    good having clean filters but your gutters are overflowing with oil as this increases the likelihood
                    of a fire and shortens the life of the filters.</p>

                </p>

                <p>The hood is joined to a ducting (flue) system which flows through to the extraction fan. The fan
                    draws air from the kitchen, through the honeycomb filters, the duct system to the fan where it is
                    expelled into the environment. Grease and other food particles build up in the ducting system
                    impacting on the airflow and the speed in which the fan works. We have removed dead cockroaches,
                    rates, mice, birds and possums from filthy ducting systems. If the fan is not cleaned regularly, it
                    will gradually slow down and stop altogether leaving a build-up of smoke and fumes in your
                    kitchen.</p>

                <h1>The Importance of cleaning Ducts &amp; Fans</h1><i class="underline-header "><br></i></div>

            <p>Many insurance companies and environmental health departments require the ducting system to be cleaned on
                a regular basis usually every twelve months depending on the type of food outlet. Some companies require
                their ducts to be cleaned every four months.</p>

            <p>The duct cleaning cycle will depend on the environmental situation, the type of cooking your
                establishment is involved in, the frequency of the filter exchange and hood cleans, the setup of the fan
                system and most important your insurance company requirements.</p><span
            class="services-important-section "><p>A primary defence against fire hazards in any kitchen is regular maintenance of the ducting system. Kitchens can become hot and even a small flare up while cooking can lead to flames entering the ducting system causing a fire. The intensity of the fire could be determined by the build-up of grease and particles in the ducting system. You wouldnâ€™t want to see your business go up in smoke or cause an injury to a member of your staff. A regular clean means a safer ducting system preventing a build-up of fat.</p><p>When Authentic Filters cleans a ducting system, the area behind the filters including the internal surface of the ducting system to the fan is cleaned. This process also covers the fan and housing on the roof. In many situations Authentic Filters needs to cut and install access panels into the ducting system to allow for a professional and thorough clean.</p></span>
